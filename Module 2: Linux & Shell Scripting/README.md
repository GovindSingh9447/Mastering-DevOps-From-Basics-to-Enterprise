## **Linux Basics**
### **What is Linux? Overview and Key Features**
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel. It is widely used in servers, cloud computing, embedded systems, and even personal computers.

### **Key Features of Linux:**
1. **Open Source** â€“ Free to use, modify, and distribute.
2. **Multi-User** â€“ Supports multiple users accessing the system simultaneously.
3. **Multi-Tasking** â€“ Can run multiple programs at the same time.
4. **Security** â€“ Strong permissions, encryption, and firewall capabilities.
5. **Stability & Performance** â€“ Reliable even under heavy workloads.
6. **Shell/Command Line Interface (CLI)** â€“ Provides powerful command-line utilities for automation and system management.
7. **Portability** â€“ Runs on various hardware architectures (e.g., x86, ARM, RISC).
8. **Extensive Software Support** â€“ Supports many programming languages, tools, and applications.

## **Linux File System Hierarchy and Key Directories**
Linux follows a standard directory structure known as the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**.

### **Important Directories in Linux**
- **`/` (Root Directory)** â€“ The top-level directory of the filesystem.
- **`/bin` (Binary Files)** â€“ Essential command binaries like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`.
- **`/sbin` (System Binaries)** â€“ Commands for system administration like `fdisk`, `iptables`.
- **`/etc` (Configuration Files)** â€“ System-wide configuration files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`).
- **`/home` (User Directories)** â€“ Stores personal files and settings for users.
- **`/var` (Variable Data)** â€“ Logs, databases, email, and cache (`/var/log`).
- **`/usr` (User Programs)** â€“ Contains installed programs, libraries, and documentation.
- **`/tmp` (Temporary Files)** â€“ Stores temporary files, cleaned on reboot.
- **`/opt` (Optional Software)** â€“ Third-party applications.
- **`/dev` (Device Files)** â€“ Represents hardware devices (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/tty`).
- **`/mnt` and `/media` (Mount Points)** â€“ Used for mounting external drives.

## **Virtual Machines**
### **Introduction to VMs: Structure, Components, and Ports**
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a computer system that runs an operating system independently of the host system.

### **Key Components of a VM**
1. **Hypervisor** â€“ Manages VMs (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox, KVM).
2. **Virtual CPU (vCPU)** â€“ Simulated processor cores.
3. **Virtual Memory (RAM)** â€“ Allocated from the host.
4. **Virtual Disk** â€“ Stores OS and data.
5. **Network Interfaces** â€“ Virtual network adapters.

### **Creating and Connecting to a VM via SSH**
1. **Create a VM** using a hypervisor (VirtualBox, KVM, AWS, etc.).
2. **Install an OS** (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.).
3. **Enable SSH** (`sudo systemctl enable ssh && sudo systemctl start ssh`).
4. **Find VMâ€™s IP Address** using `ip a` or `ifconfig`.
5. **Connect via SSH** from another machine:  
   ```bash
   ssh user@vm-ip-address
   ```

### **Managing Ports and Access**
- Open a specific port:  
  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 22  # Allows SSH traffic
  ```
- Check listening ports:  
  ```bash
  netstat -tulnp
  ```

## **Essential Linux Commands**
### **Basic Linux Commands**
- `ls` â€“ List files and directories.
- `pwd` â€“ Show the current directory.
- `cd` â€“ Change directory.
- `cp` â€“ Copy files.
- `mv` â€“ Move/rename files.
- `rm` â€“ Remove files.
- `mkdir` â€“ Create a directory.
- `rmdir` â€“ Remove an empty directory.

### **Advanced Linux Commands**
- `find /path -name "filename"` â€“ Search for a file.
- `grep "pattern" file.txt` â€“ Search text inside files.
- `tar -cvf archive.tar file/` â€“ Create an archive.
- `tar -xvf archive.tar` â€“ Extract an archive.
- `df -h` â€“ Check disk usage.
- `top` â€“ Monitor system performance.

## **Package Management**
### **Installing, Updating, and Removing Packages**
#### **Debian-based Systems (Ubuntu, Debian)**
- Install a package:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install package-name
  ```
- Update package lists:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```
- Remove a package:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt remove package-name
  ```

#### **Red Hat-based Systems (CentOS, Fedora)**
- Install a package:  
  ```bash
  sudo yum install package-name
  ```
- Update packages:  
  ```bash
  sudo yum update
  ```

---

## **File and Folder Permissions**
### **Understanding and Managing Permissions**
Each file has three permission groups:
- **Owner** (`u`)
- **Group** (`g`)
- **Others** (`o`)

### **Permission Types**
- `r` â€“ Read
- `w` â€“ Write
- `x` â€“ Execute

Change file permissions:
```bash
chmod 755 file.sh
```
Change ownership:
```bash
chown user:group file.txt
```

---

## **User & Group Management**
### **Adding, Modifying, and Deleting Users/Groups**
- Add a user:  
  ```bash
  sudo adduser username
  ```
- Add a group:  
  ```bash
  sudo groupadd groupname
  ```
- Delete a user:  
  ```bash
  sudo deluser username
  ```

---

## **Linux Networking**
### **Common Networking Commands**
- `ip a` â€“ Show IP addresses.
- `ping google.com` â€“ Test network connectivity.
- `netstat -tulnp` â€“ Show active connections.
- `traceroute google.com` â€“ Trace the route to a host.

### **Managing Network Interfaces**
- Restart networking service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart networking
  ```

---

## **Linux Troubleshooting**
### **Practical Examples and Error Handling**
- Check system logs:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -xe
  ```
- Identify disk space issues:
  ```bash
  df -h
  ```
- Kill a process:
  ```bash
  kill -9 PID
  ```

---

## **Shell Scripting**
### **Writing and Executing Scripts for Automation**
A shell script is a sequence of commands saved in a file.

#### **Example: Basic Shell Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, $USER! Today is $(date)"
```
Run it:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

### **Corporate-level Shell Scripting Examples**
1. **Backup Automation:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   tar -czf backup.tar.gz /home/user/
   ```
2. **Automated System Update:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
3. **Log Monitoring:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   tail -f /var/log/syslog
   ```

### **Conclusion**
Mastering Linux is essential for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers. Learning file management, networking, troubleshooting, and automation using shell scripting will greatly improve productivity and efficiency.
